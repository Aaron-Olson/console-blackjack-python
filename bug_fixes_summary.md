# Bug Fixes Summary - Blackjack Game

## Overview
I identified and fixed 3 critical bugs in the blackjack.py codebase, including logic errors, security vulnerabilities, and payout calculation issues.

## Bug 1: Logic Error - Incorrect 10-value Card Recognition

**Location**: `set_totals()` method, line 115
**Severity**: High - Game Breaking

### Problem
The code was checking for `'1'` instead of `'10'` when identifying 10-value cards:
```python
if card[0] in {'J', 'K', 'Q', '1'}:  # BUG: '1' should detect '10' cards
```

This meant that 10-value cards (which should be worth 10 points) were not being recognized and would default to a value of 0, completely breaking the game logic.

### Root Cause
The developer incorrectly assumed that 10-value cards would start with '1', but the card representation is "10 of ♠" not "1 of ♠".

### Fix
Changed the condition to properly detect 10-value cards:
```python
if card[0] in {'J', 'K', 'Q'} or card.startswith('10'):
```

### Impact
This fix ensures that 10s, Jacks, Kings, and Queens are all properly valued at 10 points, making the game functional.

## Bug 2: Logic Error - Incorrect Blackjack Payout

**Location**: `player_win()` method, line 181-184  
**Severity**: Medium - Financial Logic Error

### Problem
The blackjack payout calculation was incorrect. When a player got a natural blackjack (21 with first two cards), they should receive 3:2 odds (1.5x their bet plus their original bet back), but the code was only adding 1.5x the bet to money that already had the bet deducted.

```python
if self.p_bj:
    self.p_money += 1.5 * self.p_bet  # BUG: Only 0.5x profit instead of 1.5x
```

### Root Cause
The developer forgot that the original bet was already deducted from `p_money` in the `bet()` method, so they needed to return both the original bet AND the 1.5x winnings.

### Fix
Corrected the payout to properly return the original bet plus 1.5x winnings:
```python
if self.p_bj:
    # Blackjack pays 3:2 - return original bet plus 1.5x winnings
    self.p_money += self.p_bet + (1.5 * self.p_bet)
```

### Impact
Players now receive the correct blackjack payout of 2.5x their original bet (original bet returned + 1.5x winnings), instead of only 1.5x.

## Bug 3: Security Vulnerability - Insufficient Input Validation

**Location**: `bet()` method, line 60-63
**Severity**: Medium - Security/Stability Issue

### Problem
The betting input had no validation, allowing several problematic scenarios:
1. **Negative bets**: Players could enter negative amounts
2. **Excessive bets**: Players could bet more money than they have
3. **Invalid input**: Non-numeric input would crash the program

```python
self.p_bet = int(input("| Enter bet for this hand | : $"))  # No validation
```

### Root Cause
No input validation or error handling was implemented for user input.

### Fix
Implemented comprehensive input validation with a retry loop:
```python
while True:
    try:
        self.p_bet = int(input("| Enter bet for this hand | : $"))
        if self.p_bet <= 0:
            print("Bet must be greater than $0. Try again.")
        elif self.p_bet > self.p_money:
            print(f"You don't have enough money. Maximum bet: ${self.p_money}")
        else:
            break
    except ValueError:
        print("Please enter a valid number.")
```

### Impact
- Prevents crashes from invalid input
- Ensures players can only make valid, positive bets
- Prevents players from betting more money than they have
- Provides clear error messages to guide user behavior

## Testing Recommendations

To verify these fixes:

1. **Test 10-value cards**: Deal hands with 10s and face cards to ensure they're valued correctly
2. **Test blackjack payouts**: Get a natural 21 and verify the payout is 2.5x the original bet
3. **Test input validation**: Try entering negative numbers, amounts larger than available money, and non-numeric input

## Additional Issues Identified (Not Fixed)

While reviewing the code, I also noticed:
- Minor performance issue with using `list.pop()` for card dealing
- Potential logic issue in dealer soft 17 handling
- Missing features mentioned in TODO comments

These could be addressed in future iterations if needed.
